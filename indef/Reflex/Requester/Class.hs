-- | This module defines 'Requester', which indicates that an action can make
-- requests and receive responses to them.  Typically, this is used for things
-- like a WebSocket, where it's desirable to collect many potential sources of
-- events and send them over a single channel, then distribute the results back
-- out efficiently to their original request sites.

-- | A 'Requester' action can trigger requests of type @Request m a@ based on
-- 'Event's, and receive responses of type @Response m a@ in return.  Note that
-- the @a@ type can vary within the 'Requester' action, but will be linked for a
-- given request.  For example, if @Request m@ is 'IO' and @Response m@ is
-- 'Identity', then 'requestingIdentity' has the same type as
-- 'Reflex.PerformEvent.Class.performEvent'.
